# The Types of Films You Should Create

# Project Overview
Large media companies are investing heavily in original content. A company planning to launch a new movie studio wants to understand what types of films perform best before committing capital.
This project analyzes data from IMDb and Box Office Mojo to answer a simple but important question:
  What genres of movies are most successful, both critically and financially?

Using real-world film data, I explore:
-Which genres are produced most frequently
-Which genres receive the highest average ratings
-Which genres generate the highest box office revenue

The goal is to translate data into actionable recommendations for a new studio deciding what kinds of films to produce.

# Data sources
-IMDb database (ratings, genres, metadata)
-Box Office Mojo dataset (domestic and foreign gross revenue)

The analysis includes:
-90K+ film rating records
-2K+ films with complete domestic and foreign gross data
-SQL joins between movie metadata and revenue datasets

# Methods
-Data cleaning and preprocessing with Pandas
-SQL queries on relational IMDb database
-Feature engineering including total gross revenue
-Genre decomposition for multi-label classification
-Aggregation and statistical comparison of ratings and revenue
-Data visualization with Seaborn and Matplotlib

# Key Findings
-Adventure films generate the highest average box office revenue
-Animation and Sci-Fi also show strong financial performance
-Documentaries and Biographies tend to receive higher average ratings
-High production volume does not necessarily mean high profitability
